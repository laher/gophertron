gophertron
==========

This package is just the code for a short talk on Go's coverage testing & the [httptest](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest/) package.

Gophertron is a JSON API for spawning, mutating, zapping & kapowing gophers.

Please [visit gocover.io to see the coverage report](http://gocover.io/github.com/laher/gophertron/gophers) ![coverage status](http://gocover.io/_badge/github.com/laher/gophertron/gophers?)

There is one bug which has been intentionally left uncaptured by the tests.
